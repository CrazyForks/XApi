# XApi HTTP Client

A high-performance, open-source Chrome extension (Manifest V3) that brings a Postman-like workflow directly into your browser's DevTools. XApi intercepts, debugs, edits, and replays HTTP requests — with first-class support for modifying sensitive headers such as `Cookie`, `Origin`, and `Referer`, mocking responses, and injecting request headers globally.

## Overview

Debug directly while you browse without switching tabs, and manage collections and complex requests in a dedicated window.

## Features

### Request interception and replay
- Automatically capture Fetch and XHR traffic from the active tab.
- Edit any captured request's body, headers, or query parameters and replay it with one click.
- Paste raw cURL commands to instantly generate fully editable request objects.
- Organize requests into nested collections with persistent storage.

### Modify Header (global request headers)
Inject or override request headers across every XHR/Fetch call, without editing individual requests.

- Managed from the **Header** tab in the extension popup, backed by Chrome's `declarativeNetRequest` (DNR) engine.
- Each header row has an enable checkbox, a key, and a value; toggle rows individually and flip the global master switch to activate all enabled headers at once.
- Headers are applied as `SET` operations, so they add the header when absent and override it when present.
- Scope is limited to `XMLHttpRequest` resources, matching XApi's capture range, and the rule is rebuilt automatically whenever you change a header or toggle the switch.
- Because it runs through DNR, it can set headers the browser normally protects — including `Cookie`, `Origin`, and `Referer` — that page scripts cannot change on their own.
- Global header rules use a dedicated DNR rule and a lower priority than one-off replay rules, so replaying a single request can still override a global header of the same name for that call.

### Sensitive header injection on replay
When replaying a single request, XApi can override restricted headers (`Cookie`, `Origin`, `Referer`) that standard page scripts are blocked from setting, so replayed requests faithfully reproduce the original call.

### Mock and response override
Intercept live requests and serve custom responses without touching the backend — useful for front-end development, edge-case testing, and reproducing bugs.

- **URL matching**: rules match by URL prefix (`startsWith`) and HTTP method (`GET` / `POST` / `PUT` / `DELETE` / `ANY`).
- **Replace mode**: fully override the response with a custom status code, `Content-Type`, and body (JSON, text, HTML, etc.).
- **JSON Patch mode**: keep the original response and surgically modify specific fields via JSON paths (e.g. `data.user.name`, `data.list[0].id`). Use the `::raw::` prefix to inject numbers, booleans, `null`, or nested JSON.
- **One-click mock from capture**: right-click any captured response and choose *"Mock this response"* to auto-generate a rule pre-filled with the current payload.
- **Per-rule toggle and global switch**: enable or disable individual rules, or flip the global mock master switch. Hit counters and last-hit timestamps confirm rules are firing.

## Getting Started

### Installation

#### Via Chrome Web Store (recommended)
XApi is available on the Chrome Web Store. Search for **XApi** or use the link below:
- [XApi - HTTP Client & API Test](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/xapi-http-client-api-test/ilcnglohbiokfdcokfceihebobkpeaij?authuser=0&hl=en)

#### Manual installation (from source)
1. Clone and build:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lustan/XApi.git
   cd XApi
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
2. Load in Chrome:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable **Developer mode** (top right)
   - Click **Load unpacked** and select the `dist` folder.

### Usage

1. Open **Chrome DevTools** (`F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
2. Switch to the **XApi** tab.
3. Interactions on the current page appear in the **Captured** history.
4. Select any request to edit its body, headers, or query params, then hit **Send**.

#### Injecting global headers

1. Open the extension popup and switch to the **Header** tab.
2. Add a header with **+ Add Header**, fill in the key and value, and tick its checkbox to enable it.
3. Turn on the global header switch. Every XHR/Fetch request from then on carries the enabled headers.
4. Disable a single row or flip the global switch off to stop injection at any time.

#### Mocking a response

1. Open the **Mock** tab in the sidebar and make sure the global mock switch is on.
2. Click **New Rule** to define one from scratch, or right-click a captured response and pick **"Mock this response"** to seed a rule from the live payload.
3. Set the **URL pattern** (prefix match) and **method**, then choose a mode:
   - **Replace** — write the full status / `Content-Type` / body you want returned.
   - **JSON Patch** — add patch rows like `data.user.name = Alice`. Prefix with `::raw::` to inject non-string JSON values, e.g. `::raw::42`, `::raw::true`, `::raw::{"k":1}`.
4. Reload the page or trigger the request — the rule's hit counter confirms it fired.
